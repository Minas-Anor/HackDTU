Blockchain

## Idea
It is difficult for companies (especially government organizations) to track the attendance of employees which is often altered or of which no proper record is created.
<br>
The blockchain solution helps create a secure database for keeping track of employees' attendance. The concept can be further extended using the idea of 'Smart Contracts' to reward the employees on the basis of their working hours/ number of days worked.
